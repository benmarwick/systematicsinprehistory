## Contents

The most important parts of this compendium are:

-   [:dart: \_targets.R](_targets.R): workflow instructions and
    information indicating the order that code needs to be run to
    generate the results. Run `targets::tar_make()` at the R console to
    start the analysis workflow.  
-   [:file\_folder: analysis/paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source
    document for manuscript, and R script files. Includes code to
    reproduce the figures and tables generated by the analysis. It also
    has a rendered version, `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code
    is replaced by figures and tables in this file)
-   [:file\_folder: analysis/data](/analysis/data): Data used in the
    analysis.
-   [:file\_folder: analysis/figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and
    other illustrations

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benmarwick/systematicsinprehistory/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org
Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational
environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping you can run our code
by followinfg these steps:

1.  open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio  
2.  run `renv::restore()` to download and install the packages required
    to run our code  
3.  run `targets::tar_make()` to run our code in order, the final step
    of this will be knitting the R Markdown document to produce the
    `paper.docx`
